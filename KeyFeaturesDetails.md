## Key Features - Details

#### Dynamic Building System
Players can build freely, but are required to attach above-ground builds to existing builds, similar to systems in games like Fortnite. Additionally, placing a build is only allowed if it does not significantly overlap with other objects. The system includes real-time preview mechanics to help players visualize placement before committing, and a mode for deleting specific previously placed builds.
#### Interactive Farming Mechanics
The farming system uses proximity-based detection to identify nearby farmable objects, and automatically selects the appropriate tool for interaction when the farming key is pressed. This ensures a smooth, intuitive experience while reducing keybind complexity. Each farmable object can only be farmed a certain amount of times, but this number regenerates over time, even if the farmable object is being stored in the player's inventory.
#### Flexible and Robust Inventory System
All in-game objects are represented as items within a unified inventory system. Each item is equipped with unique descriptions and buy/sell values. The system automatically stacks and sorts items, and players can move or swap items freely. Drag-and-drop functionality is used to simplify item management and enhance user experience.
#### Customizable Environment
Utilizing the inventory system, players have the freedom to reshape their environment by capturing objects into their inventory and re-placing them in real time. This feature allows for complete creative control, enabling players to design their oasis as they see fit. Capturing an object is achieved by launching a projectile from a bow, creating an engaging player experience.
#### Space Race Minigame
A standalone game mode with unique movement, attack, and camera mechanics, the space race minigame offers a distinctly different gameplay experience. The checkpoint locations and obstacle behaviors are randomized with each playthrough, enhancing replayability. It has multiple difficulties with conditional rewards and 'best time' tracking, and the rewards earned tie back to the main game’s economy.
#### Performant Autosave Functionality
Progress is saved whenever any key action occurs, such as buying, selling, or placing objects. This ensures that progress is retained even in the event of a crash, and is implemented in a way that reduces the potential for exploits. To maintain performance, the autosave system breaks down data-saving tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks, and only saves the data fields which have been changed.
#### Scalable Systems
The game’s core systems are built with scalability in mind, enabling the addition of new items, objects, and sounds with minimal code changes. Centralized manager scripts are used to ensure that functionality is well-organized and easy to expand.
