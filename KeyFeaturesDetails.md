## Key Features - Details

**Dynamic Building System:**
<br>
Players can build freely, but are required to attach above-ground builds to existing builds, similar to systems in games like Fortnite. Additionally, placing a build is only allowed if it does not significantly overlap with other objects. The system includes real-time preview mechanics to help players visualize placement before committing, and a mode for deleting specific previously placed builds.
<br>
<br>
**Interactive Farming Mechanics:**
<br>
The farming system uses proximity-based detection to identify nearby farmable objects, and automatically selects the appropriate tool for interaction when the farming key is pressed. This ensures a smooth, intuitive experience while reducing keybind complexity. Each farmable object can only be farmed a certain amount of times, but this number regenerates over time, even if the farmable object is being stored in the player's inventory.
<br>
<br>
**Flexible and Robust Inventory System:**
<br>
All in-game objects are represented as items within a unified inventory system. This allows players to seamlessly capture objects into their inventory, sell them for in-game currency, or re-place them elsewhere in the environment. Each item is equipped with unique descriptions and buy/sell values. Drag-and-drop functionality is used to simplify item management and enhance user experience.
<br>
<br>
**Customizable Environment:**
<br>
Players have the freedom to reshape their environment dynamically by capturing objects into their inventory and re-placing them in real time. This feature allows for complete creative control, enabling players to design their oasis as they see fit. Seamless integration with the inventory system ensures a smooth transition between capturing and re-placing objects.
<br>
<br>
**Space Race Minigame:**
<br>
A standalone game mode with unique movement, attack, and camera mechanics, offering a distinctly different gameplay experience. The track and obstacle locations are randomized each playthrough, enhancing replayability. It has multiple difficulties with conditional rewards and 'best time' tracking, and rewards earned tie back to the main game’s economy.
<br>
<br>
**Performant Autosave Functionality:**
<br>
Automatically saves progress whenever any key action occurs, such as buying, selling, or placing objects. This ensures that progress is retained even in the event of a crash, as well as preventing exploits. To maintain performance, the autosave system is designed to break down data-saving tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.
<br>
<br>
**Easily Extensible Systems:**
<br>
The game’s core systems are built with scalability in mind, enabling the addition of new items, objects, and sounds with minimal code changes. Centralized manager scripts ensure that functionality is well-organized and easy to expand.
