## Key Features - Details

**Dynamic Building System:**
<br>
Players can build freely, but are required to attach above-ground builds to existing builds, similar to systems in games like Fortnite. Builds are not allowed to be placed if it overlaps with another object in the game.
<br>
<br>
**Interactive Farming Mechanics:**
<br>
Proximity-based farming system that detects nearby farmable objects and selects the appropriate tool automatically. Includes object-specific resource regeneration.
<br>
<br>
**Flexible and Robust Inventory System:**
<br>
All objects in the game are represented as items, allowing them to be added to inventory, sold, or re-placed seamlessly. Items include unique descriptions and buy/sell values.
<br>
<br>
**Customizable Environment:**
<br>
Players can dynamically modify the scene by capturing (adding to inventory) and re-placing objects in real time. This system provides full freedom for reshaping the environment while maintaining smooth integration with inventory mechanics.
<br>
<br>
**Space Race Minigame:**
<br>
A standalone game mode with unique movement, attack, and camera mechanics, offering a distinct gameplay experience. It has multiple difficulties with conditional rewards, and rewards earned tie back to the main gameâ€™s economy.
<br>
<br>
**Performant Autosave Functionality:**
<br>
Automatically saves progress whenever any key action occurs. This ensures that a player does not lose progress even in the event of a crash. Data saving is divided into subsections to maintain performant gameplay.
<br>
<br>
**Easily Exentensible Systems:**
<br>
Core systems are built to accommodate the addition of new items, objects, and sounds with minimal code changes, allowing for future expansion with available assets.
