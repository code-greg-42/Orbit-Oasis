# Orbit Oasis 🚀
Orbit Oasis is a casual, creative, exploratory game where players can build up and modify their environment. Set from the perspective of a recently freed robot who has been granted their own plot of land, players can plant trees, build structures, raise animals, and create an oasis in any way they choose.

The game was created as a portfolio project with the intent of showcasing programming skills, and only free and available-for-use assets were used.

## Key Features 🌟
- **Dynamic Building System**: Players can build freely, but are required to attach above-ground builds to existing builds, similar to systems in games like Fortnite.
- **Interactive Farming Mechanics**: Proximity-based farming system that detects nearby farmable objects and selects the appropriate tool automatically. Includes object-specific resource regeneration.
- **Flexible and Robust Inventory System**: All objects in the game are represented as items, allowing them to be added to inventory, sold, or re-placed seamlessly. Items include unique descriptions and buy/sell values.
- **Customizable Environment**: Players can dynamically modify the scene by capturing (adding to inventory) and re-placing objects in real time. This system provides full freedom for reshaping the environment while maintaining smooth integration with inventory mechanics.
- **Space Race Minigame**: A standalone game mode with unique movement, attack, and camera mechanics, offering a distinct gameplay experience. It has multiple difficulties with conditional rewards, and rewards earned tie back to the main game’s economy.
- **Performant Autosave Functionality**: Automatically saves progress whenever any key action occurs. This ensures that a player does not lose progress even in the event of a crash. Data saving is divided into subsections to maintain performant gameplay.
- **AI Navigation for Animals**: Dynamically updates the navigation mesh when objects are moved or placed in the scene, allowing accurate pathfinding in a changing environment.
- **Easily Exentensible Systems**: Core systems are built to accommodate the addition of new items, objects, and sounds with minimal code changes, allowing for future expansion with available assets.
