# Orbit Oasis 🚀
Orbit Oasis is a casual, creative, exploratory game where players can build up and modify their environment. Set from the perspective of a recently freed robot who has been granted their own plot of land, players can plant trees, build structures, raise animals, and create an oasis in any way they choose.

The game was created as a portfolio project with the intent of showcasing programming skills, and only free and available-for-use assets were used.
