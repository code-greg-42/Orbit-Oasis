**Farming and Building:**

- **Resource Collection:** Gather materials from the environment.
- **Building Structures:** Construct buildings to expand your farm and improve your living conditions.

- **Animals:**
  - **Land Animals:** Various land animals will be scattered around the island, and can be caught and kept as pets, or used as food. Catching them uses a gun that shoots a projectile which "sucks up" the nearest animal (if within the radius)
